        "content": "Dear Friend, This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in Minnesota. \u00a0The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the breeze rustled their limbs. \u00a0We had such a great time renewing old friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on everyone's lives. \u00a0The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards. In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not find myself in the picture. \u00a0I looked and looked and finally got out a magnifying glass. \u00a0To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! \u00a0Dear God it was me!!! \u00a0My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should a heavy wind arise... it was HIDEOUS ! \u00a0I had mirrors in my house but most of them were designed to only reflect \u00a0from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a shapeless clump of flesh. \u00a0I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot of wrinkles, \u00a0but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum. Well, this situation was NOT acceptable. \u00a0But I was at a loss as to what to do. \u00a0My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. \u00a0Plus, I hate diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall off the food wagon. \u00a0My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless. AND THEN IT HAPPENED . \u00a0I received a brochure about a product called BERRY TRIM PLUS . \u00a0It seemed to contain everything I needed. \u00a0 It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, \u00a0 AND IT 'S ALL NATURAL WITH NO ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS . \u00a0It also was priced well below other products so I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. \u00a0It is guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me. It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that famous Cindy person that models. \u00a0My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. \u00a0 BERRY TRIM PLUS also keeps your skin tight so you don't look like a Shar Pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight. I promise you that this product works. \u00a0It does everything it promises and then some. \u00a0Just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much better and younger. \u00a0It puts zest back into your life and assures you that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. \u00a0In another few weeks I will reach my goal...something I had given up on. \u00a0Also, HLNA offers an affiliate program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.
